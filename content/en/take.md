Taking the step of going to a psychologist is not always easy. For this reason, I try to create a safe and confidential space where one can think, feel and express what one needs in order to understand what is happening to one.

I have trained in different therapeutic orientations and techniques and I apply in each case, and in a consensual manner with the patient, the most appropriate approach according to the characteristics and demands of the patient, always applying those treatments that have proven most effective. I try to integrate my clinical, research and teaching experience into the sessions to help the patient recover their emotional well-being.
After assessing the case and agreeing with the patient on the convenience of undergoing treatment, we jointly decide what objectives we are going to work on and what is the best therapeutic option.

Psychological therapy not only helps to improve symptoms, but also provides strategies for greater self-knowledge and to feel better about oneself and in relationships with others. It also allows people to modify the narrative they have about themselves, about the world, and about their interpersonal relationships.
